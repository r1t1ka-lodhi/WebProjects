How It Works:
The flashcard initially displays a question.

Clicking "Show Answer" reveals the answer.

Clicking "Hide Answer" hides it again.

Clicking "Next" or "Previous" moves between flashcards.

The progress bar updates as you navigate through the flashcards.

This setup is fully functional and easy to expand by adding more flashcards to the JavaScript array.
